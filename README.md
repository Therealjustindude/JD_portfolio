## About Me

As a passionate software engineer, I specialize in React and Ruby on Rails, bringing over 3 years of experience to the table. My journey with JavaScript naturally led me to explore React and delve into front-end development, where I found my passion. Currently, I am immersed in TypeScript, enjoying the benefits of type safety in the front-end realm. While my heart lies in crafting engaging user experiences, I'm also open to exploring back-end technologies and have a growing interest in type-safe languages like Go and Java for their potential impact on the full-stack development landscape.

At CoreLogic, my current focus is on elevating the lender UI flow using React, TypeScript, and MUI components within a meticulously organized monorepo structured with nx. This experience has sharpened my ability to troubleshoot and fix bugs effectively.

I thrive on creating innovative applications and embracing new technologies, always with an eye on enhancing workflow and communication within companies. Throughout my career, I've achieved significant milestones, such as being promoted from junior to Software Engineer 1 by demonstrating exceptional teamwork and mentorship. I played a crucial role in helping new team members navigate legacy code and shared valuable tips and tricks for their success.

Another notable accomplishment is my pivotal role as a key member of the small team at Roostify that successfully rebuilt the Borrower UI to industry standards. This effort played a crucial role in Roostify's acquisition. Now at CoreLogic, I continue to enhance the product, showcasing my dedication and ongoing value to the team.

Currently, I am exploring SvelteKit and using it to build personal projects. Outside of coding, I enjoy creating music, spending time with my family, and taking care of my three dogs. I strongly believe in the importance of self-reflection, debugging, and refactoring to improve my skills. Letâ€™s connect and explore exciting opportunities together!

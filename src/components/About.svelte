<h2>About Me</h2>
<div>Hello there! My name is Justin and I am a software engineer with a passion for crafting elegant and efficient code. I began my coding journey in February 2020, when I enrolled in a boot camp to learn the ins and outs of software development. Fast forward to December 2020, and I was a proud graduate ready to take on the world of tech.

	In March 2021, I landed my first career job as a software engineer and have been loving every moment of it. I started off maintaining legacy code using Ruby on Rails and React, but now I am part of a team that is re-building the frontend using React and TypeScript. It's been a thrilling ride so far and I am excited to see where my career takes me next.
	
	When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies, playing video games, or just hanging out with friends. Thanks for stopping by and learning a little bit about me!</div>
